I want to determine a method for adding additional animations to an existing character
and animation library

the reason I want to do this is I initially plan to make a vertical slice of the game
that is very bare bones. But I want to be able to update it over time
- adding things like
	pick up and throw
	golf swing
	ninja jump
	climb
	slide
	crawl
	etc

This will also tie into adding additional skills to the player as I develop the game as well

so really, it's like figuring out a composition system
for both animation and items.

The reason I want to do it this way is massively reduce the workload
that I feel I 'have' to do, before even confirming if this is the direction
I want to head in.
